A Vindinium bot using Behaviour Trees

[Vindinium](http://vindinium.org/) is an AI competition where the goal is to write a bot that collects gold from mines.


This is my attempt using [Behaviour Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Trees) via [Machine JS](https://github.com/maryrosecook/machinejs) (I maintain [my own fork](https://github.com/rfox90/machinejs)) and node.

It's undergoing intense re-factoring at the moment.
